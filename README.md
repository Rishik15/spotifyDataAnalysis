# Spotify Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of Spotify's top songs, exploring various audio features and trends. The analysis is split into two main parts: data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The aim is to uncover interesting insights into what makes a song popular on Spotify and identify patterns in music preferences.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is `spotify_top_songs_audio_features.csv`, sourced from Kaggle. It includes information on various audio features of the top songs on Spotify.

## Installation and Usage

To run this project, you will need Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed on your system. If you do not have Jupyter installed, you can install it using Anaconda or with pip:

```bash
pip install notebook
```
Once Jupyter is installed, clone this repository and navigate to the project directory. Open Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and navigate to the `.ipynb` files to view and run them.

## Project Structure

- **DataCleaning.ipynb:** This notebook focuses on preparing the data for analysis. It includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and identifying out-of-bound values.

- **ExploratoryDataAnalysis.ipynb:** This notebook dives into the cleaned data to explore various audio features of the top songs on Spotify. It utilizes visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover trends and patterns.
